The code that I created in the project that I worked can be find here.
The AFM and the FALCON instruments have two section, the first is the analysis using MATLAB programming and then Python is used for graphical representain of the data,
AFM has used MATLAB 2022 version and the FALCON used the MATLAB 2017 version.
The Leica Stereo has its analysis section using "tierpsy" programming. The GitHub of the tierpsy is provided in the ReadMe file on the relevant folder.
The touch assay does not need any data analysis and the graphical representing program in Python is included.
